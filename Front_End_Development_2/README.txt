Additional notes about the submission:
--------------------------------------
Will (the other front end developer) and I worked together to create the main file, I initially created a skeleton frame for it (because had upcoming exams)
and he then worked with Griffin a little more to help get the data into the form of the graph. Once we had the data in (and were both available) we then 
worked together more to create the methods we wanted within the user Interface. Will and I had multiple zoom calls to brainstorm/problem solve until 
we had an application we both felt worked appropriately. I appreciate that the test engineers at the end when they were testing our implementation helped 
us to clean up our main class to run better.
